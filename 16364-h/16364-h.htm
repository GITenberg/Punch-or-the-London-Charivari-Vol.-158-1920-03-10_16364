<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>There are one hundred thousand more people living in London than in
  New York. But they are only just living.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The Home Rule Bill," says <i>The Irish Unionist Alliance</i>, "would,
  if put into operation, cause friction in Ireland." We are sorry to hear
  this, for friction is the last thing we want to see in Ireland.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><font class="sc">M. Grabski</font>, who has just asked for the loan of
  three thousand million francs, is the Polish Minister of Finance. Yet
  people say there is nothing in a name.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Welsh Prohibition Bill is suggested. We think it should be pointed
  out that the Welsh language is natural and not due to
  over-indulgence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><font class="sc">Dempsey</font>, the American Boxer, is to be charged
  with "draft-dodging." The other charge of <font
  class="sc">Cochran</font>-dodging will not be proceeded with.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Gold in the mouth, says the American Academy of Dental Science, is out
  of date. Much the same applies to gold in the pocket.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that an American syndicate has been formed for the
  purpose of acquiring the sole rights in a suit of clothes by a London
  tailor.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>American whisky is said to create in consumers a desire to climb
  trees. British whisky, on the other hand, seems to create in the
  Americans a desire to cross the Atlantic.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With reference to the road-mender who fell down last week and injured
  himself an explanation has now been given. It appears that the colleague
  next to him must have moved.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>No fewer than twenty-seven poems on Spring have been received by one
  weekly paper editor. Yet there are people who still maintain that the
  crime wave is on the wane.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The Irish swear by two staple beverages," says <i>The Daily Mail</i>.
  We feel, however, that an Irishman who was really trying could swear by
  more than this.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that the Foreign Office takes a serious view of the
  large number of public-houses which have been burgled during the last few
  weeks. It is feared that it may be the work of a foreign spy who is
  endeavouring to secure the recipe of British Government ale.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A large number of army tanks have been sent to Africa," announces an
  article in a daily paper. However, as the brontosaurus is supposed to
  devour four of these delicacies at every meal, it is feared that unless a
  great many more are sent out immediately this dainty animal may be faced
  with extermination.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A morning paper announces that all airships of "R 34" type are now
  obsolete. We have decided to stick a pin in each of ours.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>From Ireland comes the pleasing news that the wife of a well-known
  Sinn Feiner has just presented her husband with a little bomberette.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Since the publication of Professor <font class="sc">Keith's</font>
  statistics of efficiency, showing the superiority of the physical
  condition of miners over that of almost every other class of worker, the
  argument, so popular with the advocates of nationalisation, that a
  miner's occupation is a most unhealthy one, has been given a rest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I doubt if even the youngest child to-day will live to see the real
  fruits of the War," said the Bishop of Lincoln last week. Another
  unmerited slight on the O.B.E.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Visitors to the Zoo," says <i>The Daily Mail</i>, "should not miss
  the rare spectacle of the highest five animals under one roof&mdash;the
  gorilla, the chimpanzee, the orang-outang, the gibbon and man." Naturally
  everybody is asking, "Who is the lucky man?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A merciless campaign against rats is to be waged by the inhabitants of
  a large Yorkshire town. This is supposed to be the outcome of the
  continued indifference with which these rodents have treated the many
  propaganda campaigns which the town has organised.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Liverpool City Council is to consider the appointment of women
  park-keepers. In support it is urged that when it comes to persuading a
  paper bag to go along quietly the superior tact of a woman is bound to
  tell.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Arrangements for the continuation of the Food Ministry, it is stated,
  are still incomplete. It would be a thousand pities if a mere abundance
  of food should lead to the disappearance of this valuable department.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Will the gentlemen on the Allied Surrender List," says the <i>Berlin
  Official Gazette</i>, "inform the German authorities of their address?"
  This is a typical piece of Teutonic duplicity. There are, of course, no
  gentlemen on the List.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The chiffchaff has been heard in Hampshire and a couple of
  road-peckers were observed last week hovering in the neighbourhood of
  Wellington Street.</p>

<h2>MEN AND THINGS OF THE MOMENT.</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[Mr. Punch cannot hold himself responsible for the views expressed in
  the following correspondence.]</p>

  </blockquote>
<p class="center"><font class="sc">The Mallaby-Deeley Emporium.</font></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</font>,&mdash;I want you to use your
  influence with that great philanthropist, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Mallaby-Deeley</font>. I know that he is too modest to claim
  to be a benefactor of the race, but I am at least right in calling him
  "Mr.," for that is how he describes himself on his shop-window, and he
  would never have done that if he had not desired to avoid confusion with
  the common tradesman. Well, I want you to enlist his powerful sympathy in
  the cause of the struggling middle classes, to which body I belong. I
  refer particularly to our crying need for dinner-jackets at reasonable
  prices. I am one of those who spend their holidays at seaside hotels,
  where people make a point of dressing for dinner in the hope of giving
  their fellow-guests the impression that this is their daily habit in the
  home circle. In view of the early advent of Spring I approached my
  tailor, the other day, with inquiries as to the cost of an abbreviated
  dinner-suit. His prices were as follows:&mdash;jacket £10 10<i>s.</i>
  0<i>d.</i>; waistcoat £3 3<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>; trousers £4 10<i>s.</i>
  0<i>d.</i>; total £18 3<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> I am old enough to recall the
  time when the most <i>élite</i> tailors of Savile Row charged no more
  than £10 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> for a complete evening costume,
  uncurtailed.</p>

  <p>I am all for the cheap supply of "gentlemen's lounge-suits" for the
  so-called working-classes to lounge in. I know of no surer antidote to
  the spirit of Bolshevism. But let us not forget the claims of the middle
  classes, who are the backbone of the Empire. If Mr. <font
  class="sc">Mallaby-Deeley</font> cannot help us in the direction I have
  indicated, then let Mr. <font class="sc">Kennedy Jones</font>, on behalf
  of the Middle Class Union, put a hyphen to his name and open a shop for
  the sale of evening wear at demi-popular prices.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
      <p><font class="sc">Surbitonian</font>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</font>,&mdash;It would be a thousand
  pities if Mr. <font class="sc">Mallaby-Deeley's</font> beneficent scheme
  should fail for lack of advertisement. Could you not persuade your
  colleagues of the Press to publish from day to day the route of his car's
  progress from his private residence (or the terminus from which he
  debouches) to his place of business, as in the case of the new Member for
  Paisley? My only fear is that the Coalition Government might be suspected
  of adopting the Wee Free methods of publicity for political ends; but
  this would surely be an unworthy suspicion in the case of a movement
  designed for the benefit not of a party, but of mankind.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
      <p><font class="sc">Stage Manager</font>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><font class="sc">The Decline of Learning.</font></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Sir</font>,&mdash;I look for your sympathy when
  I say that I regard the abolition of compulsory Greek at Oxford as
  tantamount to the collapse of the last bulwark of British Culture. It is
  idle for the advocates of this act of vandalism to protest that the
  spirit of Ancient Hellas can be adequately conveyed in the form of
  translations, and to illustrate this futile argument by reference to the
  authorised version of the Hebrew Scriptures. Admirable as that version
  may be, is it for a moment to be supposed that it can take the place of
  the original as a source of spiritual education? or that our appreciation
  of Holy Writ would not be a hundred-fold increased if it were fortified
  by a knowledge of the first principles of Hebraic syntax and by an
  elementary acquaintance with Hebraic composition. It is impossible to
  estimate the influence of such knowledge in tending to endear the Bible
  to our youth. To me indeed it has always been incomprehensible that our
  Prelates, who presumably have the welfare of the Church at heart, have
  never insisted on making Hebrew a compulsory subject for Responsions.</p>

  <p>And now Greek has gone and Oxford is the home of one more lost cause.
  The gods (of the gallery) may be with the winners, but it is the losing
  side that still appeals to</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Yours incorruptibly,</p>
      <p><font class="sc">Cato</font>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">"<font class="sc"><i>The Times'</i> Flight.</font>"</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</font>,&mdash;His many friends (among
  whom I take leave to count myself) will heartily sympathise with Dr.
  <font class="sc">Chalmers Mitchell</font> on the engine troubles he has
  passed through, culminating in the enforced curtailment of his scientific
  expedition. It is gratifying to think that the pure and lofty spirit of
  research which animated the great newspaper-proprietor who sent him forth
  on this mission has been vindicated by the Doctor's discovery of an
  unmapped volcano. Regrettably the conditions under which he observed it
  precluded him from making an expert survey of it, and even from securing
  specimens of its geological structure. The possibility of such an
  unfortunate contingency, which may have escaped the consideration of the
  promoter of the expedition, was recognised by other scientists. But it
  was confidently expected by his Zoological <i>confrères</i> that his
  voyage of exploration would add largely to our knowledge of the habits
  and customs of the fauna of Africa, and notably of the giraffe, as
  coming, by the exceptional development of its neck, within closest range
  of his vision as he flew through the vast inane.</p>

  <p>Even better opportunities for the observation of animal life would, it
  was thought, occur during the occasional intervals spent on <i>terra
  firma</i> for purposes of repose or repair. And indeed one is greatly
  intrigued by the following terse and airmanlike entry in the log for
  February 20th: "Much disturbed by lions." Nothing is said of the actual
  capture of one of these interesting denizens of the jungle, but reference
  to such a feat might well have been omitted out of regard for brevity. Is
  it too much to hope that the enterprise of <i>The Times</i> may yet be
  rewarded by the addition of a live lion to the Zoological Gardens?</p>

  <p>In any case, by the exceptional opportunities he enjoyed for a careful
  study of leaking cylinder jackets, insulating tape, red-leaded joints and
  missing engines the intrepid Doctor must have added largely to his
  knowledge of mechanical science, to say nothing of the botanical
  discoveries he made when his machine came within a few inches of contact
  with a banana-tree.</p>

  <p>I, for one, look forward eagerly to his return, when he will be able
  to narrate his experience with a fulness and freedom of language
  impossible in cabled despatches.</p>

<h2>WON ON THE POSTS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With the British Army in France.</i>)</p>

  <p>The decisive victory of the Racing Club de Petiteville&mdash;late the
  <i>deuxième équipage</i> of the Sportif Club de Petiteville&mdash;over
  the <i>troisième équipage</i> of the Société Athlétique de Pont Neuf
  would not appear to have any bearing on the washing of Percival's collars
  and pyjamas; but, according to Elfred Fry, there was a poignant
  connection between the two.</p>

  <p>When the Sportif Club received the challenge they doubted whether to
  accept it, as the Société Athlétique was rumoured to include several
  veterans approaching fifteen years of age and of tremendous physique. On
  being conceded the choice of ground, however, they took up the gage and
  trained and practised with such vigour that two days before the date of
  the match Georges Darré, right back, punted his toe through a previously
  suspected weak spot in the ball and irreparably ruined it. The Société
  Athlétique was informed of the disaster and asked to supply a ball, but
  they answered that no known authority or precedent existed for visiting
  teams providing the accessories. There was also an insinuation that the
  story of the burst ball was a fabrication, designed to give the Sportif
  Club a loophole of escape from a contest that spelt certain defeat.</p>

  <p>Stung to the quick, the <i>deuxième équipage</i> made an urgent appeal
  to the <i>premier équipage</i> of the Sportif Club, who replied that this
  was the first intimation they had had of the existence of a <i>deuxième
  équipage</i>, and recommended a tourney at marbles or a combat of
  peg-tops as being more suitable to their tender years.</p>

  <p>Naturally this insult could not be brooked, and it was decided to
  break away from the parent body and reorganise under the title of the
  Racing Club de Petiteville; but this did not help them to solve the
  question of a new ball. Then it was that Théo Navet, left half, and son
  of the <i>blanchisseuse</i> in the rue Napoléon, had an inspiration, and
  Percival's pyjamas became linked up with the destinies of the club.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"It wouldn't surprise me, Sir," said Elfred on the evening when
  Petiteville was ringing with the news of the Racing Club's victory by 4
  <i>buts</i> to 2, "if you are the only officer in Mess to-night with a
  reelly clean collar."</p>

  <p>"And why am I singled out for so much honour?" asked Percival, taking
  the slacks which Elfred produced from between the mattresses. "Has the
  Washer-women's Union handed in notices and made a complimentary exception
  in my case?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir, you <i>'ave</i> been favoured, but it weren't a strike,"
  explained Elfred. "You know, Sir, there's been an alarming short ration
  of coal an' fuel down in the village for a long time, an' two days ago
  Madame Navet, who does the orficers' washing, came up an' said she was
  bokoo fashay but the washing was napood for the week, becos she couldn't
  buy, beg, borrer nor steal enough fuel to keep her copper biling.... Do
  we wear the yaller boots to-night, Sir, or the <i>very</i> yaller
  ones?"</p>

  <p>"The light pair," said Percival, "to give tone to the clean collar.
  But go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, I put it to Madame as my orficer was a very partickler gent,
  an' she'd gotter do our washing even if she 'ad to light 'er fire with
  the family dresser. She said she was desolated; <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> she 'adn't sufficient
  coal to take the chill off a mouchoir. I thought of trying to borrer a
  sack for 'er from the quarter bloke, but our relations 'ave never been
  the same since the time I took my weekly ration of 'Pink Princesses' back
  an' arsked 'im to change 'em for cigarettes with a bit o' tobacco in.</p>

  <p>"After she'd gone I took a kit inventory 'an found we was down to our
  last clean collar, an' we looked like bein' a bit grubby in the matter of
  pyjamas. I went a walk to the canteen to think it over, an' on my way
  Madame's lad came up an' said 'is team 'ad an important match for two
  days later an' could I possibly oblige 'em with a football. Being a
  sportsman&mdash;I take a franc chance in the camp football sweep every
  week&mdash;I said I'd try what I could do, knowin' of a ball which me an'
  the other batmen punt about in our rare hintervals of leisure. But then
  the thought of that washing that wasn't washed came into my mind.</p>

  <p>"'See 'ere, Meredith,' I says. 'Je voo donneray a ball si votre mère
  does our washing toot sweet.'"</p>

  <p>"'E looked blue at this an' said they couldn't get fuel nohow.</p>

  <p>"'Compree scrounge?' says I.</p>

  <p>"It seems 'e did. It seems scrounging for fuel 'ad reached such a
  pitch in the village that people took their backyard fences in at night,
  'an they 'ad posted a policeman on the station to prevent 'em sawing away
  the waiting-room. But our washing 'ad to be done, 'an I thought if I got
  the whole of this football team scrounging they might find something as
  everyone else 'ad overlooked. So I pretended to be indifferink.</p>

  <p>"'Very well,' says I. 'San fairy ann. Napoo washing&mdash;napoo
  ball.'</p>

  <p>"That set 'em to work. Next day little boys were scraping the village
  over like fowls in a farmyard, getting a chip 'ere an' a shaving there,
  an' making themselves such a nuisance that there was talk of calling the
  gendarmerie out. They would 'ave done, too, only he'd laid down for a nap
  an' left strict orders 'e wasn't to be disturbed. Then they slipped into
  the Camp, trying to lay nefarious 'ands on empty ration boxes, but the
  Camp police spotted 'em an' chivied them off. I never seen our police so
  exhausted as they were at the end of that day.</p>

  <p>"'I can't think what's taken the little varmints,' said the
  Provost-Sergeant. 'It ain't the Fifth of November.'</p>

  <p>"On the whole it wasn't a good day's 'unting, but this morning I was
  waited on by a deputation wearing striped jerseys, which they appeared to
  'ave put on at early dawn. They said the fire was lit under the copper,
  'an could they 'ave the ball?</p>

  <p>"'Doucemong!' says I. 'Allay along, an' let's see the fire first.'</p>

  <p>"Yes, it were lit, but only just. The water was lukewarm an' the fuel
  'ad nearly all burned away, an' Madame was standing looking at it
  hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"'Pas bong,' says I to the lads. 'Pas assay chaud. Voo scroungerez
  ongcore.'</p>

  <p>"They was frantic, becos it was nearly match time. I felt inclined to
  give 'em the ball, but the thought of you, Sir, in a dirty
  collar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You may keep the pair of old riding-breeches you borrowed without
  permission," interrupted Percy.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Sir. Then all at once the lads 'ad a confab an' went away,
  an' in a few minutes they was back with some lovely straight planed props
  of timber, an' they chopped 'em up in a jiffy 'an got the fire roaring
  'ot, an' I gave 'em the ball, an' your collars is done an' the rest of
  your things is out drying an' will be finished to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm grateful," said Percival. "You might tell your young
  friends I'm willing to be a vice-president of their club&mdash;on the
  usual terms. What's the name of it?"</p>

  <p>"They tell me it's called 'The Racing Club,'" said Elfred. "But I
  think, Sir, you'd better give your subscription to the other club in the
  village&mdash;'The Sportif Club.' You see, Sir, they 'ad a match on
  to-day as well, an' when they arrived on the ground they found someone
  'ad been and scrounged their goal-posts!"</p>

<h2>THE ANNIVERSARY.</h2>

  <p>Having unexpectedly retained possession of my seat in the Tube the
  other evening I over-read myself and ran past my station, so it was
  rather late when I reached home.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" I called out cheerily.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" echoed Margaret in a flat sort of voice; "you back?"</p>

  <p>I refrained from facetiousness and told her that I was.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, Margaret," I said in a bright and bustling manner, "we
  haven't got on very well so far, have we? Can't you think of some subject
  on which we can conduct a conversation in words of more than one
  syllable? The skilful hostess should so frame her questions that not even
  the shyest visitor can fall back on a simple Yes or No. Now," I
  continued, spreading myself luxuriously over the chesterfield, "you know
  how shy I am. Try to draw me out, dear. I'm waiting."</p>

  <p>I lit a cigarette. Margaret looked reproachfully at me.</p>

  <p>"What was yesterday?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Tuesday, my dear. We will now have a little chat about Tuesday.
  Coming as it does so soon after Monday, it not unnaturally
  exhibits&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tuesday the 25th of February," said Margaret solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Possibly, my dear, possibly. But I cannot say that I find your
  remarks very interesting. They may be true, or they may not, but they
  certainly seem to me to lack that agreeable whimsicality usually so
  characteristic of you."</p>

  <p>"Our wedding-day," said Margaret impressively.</p>

  <p>"Was it really?" I said in a whisper. "And you let it pass without
  reminding me. Oh, how could you?"</p>

  <p>Margaret smiled.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think of it till this morning&mdash;after you had gone," she
  said.</p>

  <p>We both smiled. Then we laughed.</p>

  <p>"You know, we really are a dreadful couple." I said. "Your fault is
  greater than mine, though. I'll tell you why. Everyone knows that a
  man&mdash;especially a manly man&mdash;" I tugged my moustache and let my
  biceps out for a run&mdash;"never remembers anniversaries, whereas a
  woman&mdash;a womanly woman&mdash;does." Here I plucked a daffodil from a
  bowl near by and tucked it coyly behind her ear.</p>

  <p>"It really is rather awful of us." Margaret restored the daffodil to
  its young companions. "We've only been married three years, too, and yet
  already&mdash;" She threw out her arms in a hopeless gesture.</p>

  <p>"Still," I said presently, with my hand full of her hand&mdash;"still
  I daresay we shall get used to it in time&mdash;forgetting the day, I
  mean. After about the fourth lapse there will be hardly any sting in our
  little piece of annual forgetfulness."</p>

  <p>"We mustn't forget to remember we've forgotten it, though, Gerald, so
  that we can test the waning powers of the sting."</p>

  <p>"I can see this habit growing on us," I said dreamily; "a few more
  years and we shall forget we are married even. I shall come home one
  day&mdash;provided I remember where we live&mdash;and be horrified to
  find <i>you</i> established in my house and using my sealing-wax. Or
  maybe I shall arrive with some little offering of early rhubarb or forced
  artichokes only to be sternly ordered away by a wife who does not
  recognise me. 'Please take your greens round to the tradesmen's
  entrance,' you will say coldly."</p>

  <p>"I think," said Margaret, "that we ought to be extra nice to each
  other now, seeing how short our married life may be. Let's begin at once.
  You let me tidy your desk every day for you and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Won't twice a week satisfy you?" I asked desperately.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps; and anyway"&mdash;she put a little packet into my
  hand&mdash;"here's <i>my</i> present to you, even though you did forget
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"You are a dear, Margaret. And now I'll tell you something. It
  was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Just then James came in and announced dinner. James is all our staff;
  but her other name is Keziah, so we had no choice.</p>

  <p>As we sat down I took a small box out of my pocket.</p>

  <p>"Give this to your mistress, please," I said to James.</p>

  <p>"O-o-o. How ripping of you, Gerald! So you did remember, after
  all."</p>

  <p>"As soon as I got to the station this morning," I said, "I remembered
  that our wedding-day was to-day."</p>

  <p>Margaret lifted her eyebrows at me. "To-day?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You are a little behind&mdash;or in front of&mdash;the times,
  I'm afraid. The twenty-fifth was a Tuesday last year, but it's trying
  Wednesday for a change now. Many Happy Returns of the Day, dear."</p>

  <p>We both laughed.</p>

  <p>"Now let's look at our presents," said Margaret happily.</p>

<h2>GOLF NOTES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With acknowledgments to Mr. A.C.M.
Croome.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Approaching.</font></p>

  <p><font class="sc">Taylor</font>&mdash;or was it <font class="sc">James
  Braid</font>?&mdash;begins one of his classic and illuminating chapters
  with the quotation "<i>Ex pede Herculem</i>," nor can even we of the
  Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society venture to differ from so eminent an
  authority or grudge him so apt a phrase. <i>Verb. sap.</i> and, let me
  add, <i>sat</i>. To those, few perhaps in actual reckoning (though I,
  wearing of right the wine-dark vesture&mdash;were there half Blues in
  <font class="sc">Homer's</font> time?&mdash;cannot compete with <font
  class="sc">John Low</font> <i>et hoc genus omne</i>, Cantabs confessed,
  in the prestidigitation of numerals and weird signs of values)&mdash;to
  those, then, few, but of many parts appreciative, who followed a certain
  foursome at Addington last week, my premiss should be intrinsically
  incontrovertible. Partner, whom I had "made" with a drive well and truly
  apportioned&mdash;<i>ex carne ictum</i>&mdash;partner, after much
  self-searching and mental recursion to the maxims of <font class="sc">Tom
  Morris</font> and <font class="sc">La Rouchefoucauld</font>, took his
  ball on the&mdash;<i>O horribile dictu</i> (or shall I say <i>horresco
  referens</i>?)&mdash;well, to be meticulously exact, partner shanked it.
  And it is just here that those who have also enjoyed a University
  education will pick up&mdash;even as partner failed to do&mdash;what I,
  who write, am driving at.</p>

  <p>Remembering how dear old W.G.&mdash;in those halcyon days when
  Gloucester was worthy of the cheese whereof she is now so chary a
  producer&mdash;used to score with that heavy cut between point and cover,
  I too, greatly daring, cut it and laid it (the ball, not the cheese)
  dead. <i>De mortuis</i> ... For assuredly it <i>was</i> good.</p>

  <p>The one adornment of this episode should have been a quotation from
  <font class="sc">Aristophanes</font>. It is not, however, given to all
  men always to remember. <i>Non cuivis</i>, in fact.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Of Impact.</font></p>

  <p>It was at the ensuing consumption of Bohea, or of its substitute as
  provided by a paternal Government, that one of the party, with the
  rashness of a <i>d'Artagnan</i>, reverted to the question of weight of
  clubs. <font class="sc">Abe Mitchell's</font> driver, of course, gave him
  a handle; but himself he, unaided, gave away. For it is not to be boasted
  by every man that he has been blessed with an <i>Alma Mater</i>, and that
  consequently logic is to him even as hair and teeth&mdash;save only that
  these twain be not false. For, said this unhappy wight, increase the
  weight and the corollary is length increased.</p>

  <p>Then arose a certain justly eminent author, whose list of tales is
  equalled only by the tale of his handicap, and demonstrably discounted
  weight without pace.</p>

  <p>It was then agreed that a test <i>ad hominem</i> should be applied,
  and that the result of such test should determine the individuality of
  him who should settle with our Ganymede. Partner and I
  pushed&mdash;<i>gemitu et fremitu</i>&mdash;a bulky sideboard against a
  paper ball. The inertia of the object was barely overcome.</p>

  <p>Then the man of letters flicked it across the room with finger and
  thumb. And the original theorist became the poorer by the commercial
  estimate of four teas and jam.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Putting.</font></p>

  <p>It has been said elsewhere, yet may not therefore be wholly lacking in
  elemental veracity, that putting is the devil. Systems more numerous than
  dactyls and spondees in Classic verse, patent putters outnumbered only by
  howlers in Oxford responsions, bear witness to this graceless statement.
  Quite lately in these columns have I confessed&mdash;<i>pulvere
  cineribusque</i>&mdash;that our side had twice failed at the
  inconsiderable <span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"
  id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span> distance of two yards, even after
  discarding the small thirty-two. But that further confession will be
  forthcoming is now wildly and preposterously problematical. For I have
  discovered the true exorcism for demoniac influence in putting. It is
  this: First catch your putter. Put the whole length of the shaft up your
  sleeve. Then&mdash;but I must retain something for next Saturday's notes,
  and, besides, I fancy the secretary of the Club where I am inditing these
  words has his frugal eye on the consumption of the note-paper. But what I
  have written I have written. <i>Litera scripta manet.</i></p>

<h2>THE COALITION OF 1950.</h2>

  <p>"Aren't you being rather badly hit by the price of tobacco?" I asked
  Charles, whose pipe is a kind of extra limb to him.</p>

  <p>"I have just been composing the plot of a novel," he replied with
  apparent irrelevance. "It begins something like this:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Slowly and softly the violet dusk set in. The beautiful young
  Première stood at the window of her yellow-and-black boudoir, gazing a
  little wistfully at the almost deserted pavements of Downing Street. A
  white pigeon perched&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"They aren't white," I said; "they're a sort of purply pinky
  grey."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Charles, unmoved, "only it rather spoils the
  sentence. 'A sort of purply pinky grey pigeon perched
  pompously&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the pigeon," I said, "tell me what was the trouble with
  the B.Y.P."</p>

  <p>"A change in the leadership of the Opposition. The old leaderess had
  just retired and her place had been taken by a new one, a man this time,
  young and handsome as Apollo, who had thrown up the Chair of
  Cinematography at the London University to plunge on to a political
  platform."</p>

  <p>"What was the programme," I inquired, "of
  this&mdash;er&mdash;furniture-remover?"</p>

  <p>"He was a reactionary," said Charles. "The Première's party had won a
  not too sweeping victory at the polls on prohibition (not of alcohol, of
  course&mdash;that had been done long ago&mdash;but of tobacco)."</p>

  <p>"How on earth did she do it?"</p>

  <p>"National economy, mostly," answered Charles. "She had the wives' vote
  solid, and they carried the more docile of the husbands with them. She
  had to throw out bribes to the unmarried electorate of both sexes, of
  course, bribes which she had since been attempting to pay. Powder and
  chocolates had been made cheaper. There was the Endowment of Cinemas Act
  of 1948, and the Subsidized Football Bill of '49. But all these
  extravagances had largely ruined the effect of the abolition of tobacco.
  At the beginning of that year she had been obliged to cancel the State
  holiday on Mondays&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why Mondays?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Everyone feels beastly on Monday."</p>

  <p>"But I don't see why they should feel any better on Tuesday."</p>

  <p>"It was twenty-four hours nearer Saturday," he replied, "and Saturday
  was also a State holiday. Labour, of course, was infuriated, and unrest
  was every day becoming more apparent. The by-elections were going against
  the Première. And now this new handsome young hero had arisen not only to
  crystallise the support of his own sex, but capture the hearts of all the
  female electorate under twenty."</p>

  <p>"Twenty!" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Everyone over fifteen had the franchise," said Charles calmly. "Now
  mark you, the programme of the Opposition was very cunning. They only
  proposed to reintroduce cigar and cigarette smoking. Edward Oburn, the
  young leader, being a film actor, naturally smoked nothing but exquisite
  Havanas. In <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg
  190]</span> this he had the support of the wealthier employers, but the
  enormous army of cigarette-suckers, male and female, was with him.</p>

  <p>"But I don't see how he proposed to cut down expenses," I
  objected.</p>

  <p>"He was going to tax the printing of all words over two syllables in
  length," replied Charles. "The Press of those days was not affected by
  the proposal, but a considerable revenue was expected from scientific
  books, high-brow novels and Socialistic publications. Well, the Première,
  as I say, was a prey to sad reflections, when suddenly the chur-chur of a
  taxi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you thinking of night-jars?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Possibly I am," he admitted; "it may have been a chug-chug. Anyway,
  it threw a wide arc of light into the gloom and stopped at the door of
  No. 10. A few moments later the door of the boudoir was flung open and
  the Chancellor of the Exchequer was announced."</p>

  <p>"What did <i>she</i> want?"</p>

  <p>"She was a he this time, and had come to announce the
  inevitable&mdash;the very thing that the Première was thinking about and
  fearing. 'We must have the Bachelor Tax,'" he said.</p>

  <p>"Now, the Bachelor Tax had been tried some twenty years before, but
  had failed, partly owing to the number of passive resisters who had had
  to be forcibly fed, and partly owing to the number of men who had shown
  substantial proof of recurrent rejections. How were they to bring in a
  reasonable and satisfactory Bill? After a long consultation, lasting
  several hours beyond midnight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did the taxi go on chugging?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Shut up. They decided eventually that if a bachelor made a written
  proposal and was rejected he was entitled to have his case tried before a
  jury of women, who should decide whether it was a reasonable offer and
  one that should normally have been accepted. If they found that it was,
  he was to be exempt from further efforts. The Bill was accordingly
  drafted, and carried easily, and the sequel no doubt you have guessed. On
  the day after it became law the beautiful young Première received a
  neatly-typed offer of marriage from Edward Oburn. They met; there was a
  scene of the utmost beauty and pathos; they became engaged, and the
  Coalition Government of the middle of 1950 began."</p>

  <p>"How long did it go on?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Until the day of revolution," said Charles pleasantly, refilling his
  foul old briar&mdash;"the great day when Fleet Street ran with blood and
  the pipe-smokers put up barricades in the Strand, and Piccadilly became a
  reeking shambles. Have you got a match?"</p>

    <p class="center">MR. ASQUITH SITS UP AND TAKES NOTICE.</p>

    <p>"<font class="sc">The Manchester School of Politics is dead and
    there is no going back to it.</font>"&mdash;<i>Mr. <font
    class="sc">Neil MacLean</font>.</i></p>
  </div>
  <p><i>Monday, March 1st.</i>&mdash;Calendar note (extracted from <i>The
  Wee Free Almanack</i>): "Asquith comes in like a lion."</p>

  <p>Everybody wanted to see the victor of Paisley make his <i>rentrée</i>.
  The Peers' Gallery was so crowded with his former colleagues that Lord
  <font class="sc">Rothermere</font> had scarcely room for the big stick
  which typifies his present attitude towards the Government. Poor Lord
  <font class="sc">Beaverbrook</font> was quite in the background; but I am
  told that on historic occasions he always prefers, with characteristic
  modesty, to be behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>As the hero of the hour walked up the floor, escorted by Sir <font
  class="sc">Donald Maclean</font> and Mr. <font class="sc">Thorne</font>,
  his supporters did their best to give him a rousing welcome. But they
  were too few to produce much effect, and a moment or two later, when Mr.
  <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> left the Treasury Bench to greet his
  old chief behind the <font class="sc">Speaker's</font> Chair, they were
  compelled to hear the young bloods of the Coalition "give a louder
  roar."</p>

  <p>Finding the traditional seat of the Leader of the Opposition still in
  the occupation of Mr. <font class="sc">Adamson</font>, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Asquith</font> bestowed himself between the Labour Leader and
  Mr. <font class="sc">Neil Maclean</font>, with whom he entered into
  conversation. If he was endeavouring to expound for his benefit the moral
  of Paisley I am afraid he had but a poor success, for in the ensuing
  debate on food-control the Member for Govan shocked Liberal hearers by
  declaring that "the Manchester School is dead and there is no going back
  to it." In opposing the continuance of D.O.R.A. Captain <font
  class="sc">Elliot</font> was again in good form. His best <i>mot</i>,
  "With the Cabinet a thing is always either <i>sub judice</i> or <i>chose
  jugée</i>," will take a good deal of beating as a summary of the
  Ministerial method of answering Questions.</p>

    DIFFICULTY.</p>

    <p><font class="sc">Mr. G.R. Thorne to ask Mr. Mallaby-Deeley
    (Controller of Suitings) what is the price of his latest
    cut.</font></p>

    <p><font class="sc">Lt.-Col. Will Thorne to ask whether any reduction
    is made in proportion to quantity of cloth purchased.</font></p>
  </div>
  <p>I understand that Mr. <font class="sc">Mallaby-Deeley</font> disclaims
  being the customer to whom the Disposals Board sold 577,000 suits of
  Government clothing. He makes a point of never being over-dressed.</p>

  <p>A suggestion that in view of the difficulty of filling diplomatic
  vacancies the Government should appoint suitable women to some of these
  posts was declined by the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> on the
  ground that it was not practicable at present. I doubt if he would have
  had the hardihood to make this avowal but that Lady <font
  class="sc">Astor</font> had been ousted from her usual seat by Mr. <font
  class="sc">Pemberton Billing</font>.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, March 2nd.</i>&mdash;Lieut.-Commander <font
  class="sc">Kenworthy</font> might be described as a pacificist who
  conducts a persistent offensive. He accused the <font class="sc">War
  Minister</font> of having made a false statement about Conscription in
  America, and later on made an allusion to General <font
  class="sc">Denikin</font> which Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font>, to
  the satisfaction of the House, which does not exactly love the Central
  Hullaballoonist, described as "a singularly ill-conditioned sneer."</p>

  <p>Lord <font class="sc">Winterton</font>, once the "baby" of the House,
  is still one of its most popular figures. Members were quite interested
  as he proceeded to explain, with an engaging blush, that a "hard case"
  which he had brought to the notice of the <font class="sc">War
  Minister</font> was his own, and sorry when the <font
  class="sc">Speaker</font> brought the narrative to a sudden stop by
  observing, "This is not the moment for autobiography."</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">First Commissioner of Works</font> was roundly
  abused for having spent £3,250 on tapestry for Hampton Court Palace. But
  when it turned out that the panel in question was the long-missing number
  of a set belonging to Cardinal <font class="sc">Wolsey</font>, and that
  its recovery was largely due to the enterprise and munificence of the
  right hon. gentleman himself, the House agreed that his completion of
  "Seven Deadly Sins" was a venial offence.</p>

  <p>Other Estimates evoked more healthy <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> criticism. Sir <font
  class="sc">Frederick Banbury</font> was eloquent upon what he called a
  "hotel for gardeners" at Kew. Mr. <font class="sc">Hogge</font> was for
  rooting up the Royal Botanical Gardens, since they were hardly ever
  visited by Scotsmen, and Captain <font class="sc">Stanley Wilson</font>
  inveighed against the extravagance with which the British delegates were
  housed in Paris. Sir <font class="sc">Alfred Mond</font> admitted that
  they "did themselves very well," but pleaded that they could hardly be
  expected to go to Montmartre&mdash;at least not collectively&mdash;and
  pointed out that some of the criticisms should be addressed to other
  Departments. He was not responsible, for example, for "clothes of
  typists."</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, March 3rd.</i>&mdash;Among the things that they do
  better in France, according to Lord <font class="sc">Sudeley</font>, is
  the popularisation of picture-galleries and museums. He instanced the
  pictures on French match-boxes. But were they always confined to
  reproductions of Louvre masterpieces? My recollection is that at one time
  they took a wider range and were distinctly more striking than the
  matches.</p>

  <p>One was reminded of <font class="sc">Praed's</font> lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Hume, no doubt, will be taking the sense</p>
      <p>Of the House on a question of thirteen-pence"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>when the Government very nearly came to grief to-night over a question
  of five pounds for the Inland Revenue offices in Manchester. In vain Mr.
  <font class="sc">Baldwin</font> pointed out the desirability of giving
  proper accommodation to the gentlemen who pick our pockets in the
  interest of the State. The House was still obstinate, until Mr. <font
  class="sc">Bonar Law</font> declared that the Government would resign if
  they did not get their "fiver." As he undertook, however, not to spend it
  without further leave, the vote at last went through.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, March 4th.</i>&mdash;Lord <font
  class="sc">Buckmaster's</font> scheme for preventing the bankruptcy of
  the State is to make everybody invest a portion of his capital in
  Government securities and to withhold the interest until such time as the
  State should find it convenient to pay. This, he explained to his own
  satisfaction, was quite different from that dangerous expedient, a levy
  on capital. Lord <font class="sc">Peel</font> took a more cheerful view
  of the situation, and indicated that it was quite unnecessary for noble
  lords to get the wind up, since the Government would have no difficulty
  in raising it.</p>

  <p>Even the most rigid economists will not cavil at the latest addition
  to our financial burdens. The <font class="sc">Pensions Minister</font>
  announced an addition of close on two millions a year to the annual
  charge. The increase is chiefly for a much-needed improvement in the
  allowances made to disabled officers, who have hitherto been but scurvily
  treated.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Higham</font> objected to receiving an answer
  about the telephones from Mr. <font class="sc">Pike Pease</font>. He
  demanded a reply from the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font>, not
  from a representative of the department impugned. The <font
  class="sc">Speaker</font>, however, pointed out that there were limits to
  the <font class="sc">Premier's</font> responsibilities: "He does not run
  the whole show." After this descent into the vernacular I half-expected
  that Mr. <font class="sc">Lowther</font> would dam the stream of
  Supplementaries that followed with, "Oh, ring off!" but he contented
  himself with calling the next Question.</p>

  <p>The debate on the Third Reading of the War Emergency Laws
  (Continuance) Bill was chiefly devoted to Ireland. Captain <font
  class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</font>, after spending a whole week in that
  country, is convinced that all the trouble is due to the Government's
  reliance upon D.O.R.A., and declared that the only people who were not in
  gaol were the murderers. That would mean that there are some four million
  assassins in Ireland; which I feel sure is an exaggeration. The two
  hundred thousand mentioned by the <font class="sc">Chief Secretary</font>
  would seem to be ample for any country save Russia.</p>

  <p>Scarcely was this gloomy episode over than the House was called upon
  to pass a Supplementary Estimate of £860 for "Peace Celebrations in
  Ireland." As £500 of this sum was for flags and decorations, which, in
  Mr. <font class="sc">Baldwin's</font> phrase, "remain for future use,"
  the Irish outlook may, after all, be not quite so black as it is
  painted.</p>

<h3>A BUY ELECTION.</h3>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[The excellent precedent set by Mr. <font
  class="sc">Mallaby-Deeley</font> in supplying needed goods at cheap rates
  may prove a little awkward if adopted by Parliamentary Candidates, as
  shown in the following anticipatory report.]</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Quiet confidence reigned in the ranks of the Muddleboro Labour Party.
  The action of their Candidate, Mr. Dulham, in arranging for a
  co-operative milk supply at sixpence per quart, was supposed to have won
  the hearts of all householders. They had no fear of Mr. Coddem, the
  representative of the great <font class="sc">Bottomley</font> party. It
  was true that Mr. Coddem had taken over a local brewery and was supplying
  beer at threepence per pint. But the Labour stalwarts argued that, in the
  first place, this would lose him the women's and temperance vote, and, in
  the second place, the electors would drink the brewery dry in
  double-quick time. All those who failed to get cheap beer would revenge
  themselves on the Candidate who had failed to keep his promise.</p>

  <p>The Wee Free cause was nearly hopeless. Their candidate, Mr. Guff, had
  made a desperate bid for popularity by offering, in conjunction with
  <i>The Daily News</i>, cocoa at reduced rates. But the Labour Candidate
  had put the pointed question, "Who made cocoa dear in the first place?"
  and Mr. Guff had evaded the question.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Stilts, the National Party Candidate, promised the public
  cheaper honours&mdash;urging that, if he were returned, it would be
  unnecessary to subscribe to party funds to get a title&mdash;the voters
  were quite unmoved. Perhaps they knew that they could get the O.B.E. for
  nothing, anyhow, and had no higher ambitions.</p>

  <p>The Coalition Candidate, Mr. Jenkins, alone said nothing. <i>The
  Star</i>, that famous organ of the Anti-Gambling Party, proclaimed
  triumphantly that the odds offered in the constituency were ten to one
  against Jenkins. But Mr. Jenkins lay low and said nothing. Or rather he
  achieved the not impossible feat in a Parliamentary contest of saying
  nothing and saying a good deal.</p>

  <p>But the day before the poll Mr. Jenkins's polling cards were
  delivered. They were headed, "Vote for Jenkins and Kill Profiteering.
  Give up this card at your polling-station for free samples of silks in my
  great blouse offer. I sell for 9<i>s.</i> 11¾<i>d.</i> a blouse usually
  priced at two guineas. Not more than six sold to any one voter. <font
  class="sc">Out Sizes no Extra Charge.</font>"</p>

  <p>A quarter-mile queue of lady-voters was standing outside the polling
  booths at eight o'clock. Hundreds of them had their husbands in custody
  with them. In vain were representations of the Full Milk Jug and the
  Flowing Pint Pot paraded before them. The Wee Free procession, headed by
  a Brimming Cocoa Cup, was received with jeers.</p>

  <p>When the poll was declared the figures ran&mdash;</p>

<h3>OPERATICS.</h3>

  <p>It has been suggested before now that Opera might be improved if the
  singing were done behind the scenes and the performance on the stage were
  carried out in dumb show by competent actors who looked their parts. But
  the idea that the movements on the stage would correspond with the
  utterances off it is not encouraged by the present lack of collusion
  between singers and orchestra&mdash;I refer to cases where a performer is
  required to simulate music on a dummy instrument.</p>

  <p>This reflection was forced upon me at a recent performance of
  <i>Tannhäuser</i>. It is true that Miss <font class="sc">Lillian
  Stanford</font> as the <i>Shepherd</i> fingered her pipe in precise
  accord with the gentleman who played the music for her. But Mr. <font
  class="sc">Mullings</font>, as <i>Tannhäuser</i>, took the greatest
  liberties with his harp. He just slapped it whenever he liked, without
  any regard to the motions of his collaborator. As for Mr. <font
  class="sc">Michael</font>, who played <i>Wolfram</i>, he was content to
  fill in the vocal pauses with a little suitable strumming; but when he
  sang he was so distracted by his own voice that he left his harp to play
  the accompaniment without visible assistance from his hand.</p>

  <p>For the fine performance which Mr. <font class="sc">Albert
  Coates</font> conducted I have no word but of praise, except that I could
  have wished that Miss <font class="sc">Elsa Stralia</font> had borne a
  closer resemblance to what is expected of <i>Elisabeth</i>. She seemed to
  want to look as much as possible like <i>Venus</i>, whose very opposite
  she should have been in type as in nature. Her colouring upset the whole
  scheme of contrast, and one never began to believe in the sincerity of
  her spiritual ideals or that her death from a broken heart was anything
  but an affectation.</p>

<h3>A LEONINE REVIVAL.</h3>

  <p>Amongst the dead lions of the past, some of us have prematurely
  reckoned those of Peterborough Court. <font class="sc">Matt.
  Arnold</font> was supposed to have administered, if not the <i>coup de
  grâce</i>, at any rate a serious blow to their gambollings in
  <i>Friendship's Garland</i>.</p>

  <p>It is therefore a matter for unfeigned rejoicing to find that they are
  not only alive but rampant, with all their old splendid command of
  polysyllabic periphrasis. One need only turn to the notice of "The John
  Exhibition" in last Thursday's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, from which we
  select the following page:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It [the exhibition] is a display of purposeful portraiture that helps
  one to realise the effect which Theotokopoulos produced upon his watchful
  contemporaries, and to understand why the Cretan continued to walk alone
  on his way. If some insist on finding modern El Greco versions of
  Inspectors and Inquisitors-general in this John gathering, compounded of
  comparatively innocuous personalities, the privilege is, of course,
  permissible, and incidentally brightens conversation in irresponsible
  circles."</p>

  <p>But a higher level of full-throated <i>bravura</i> is attained later
  on:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If reiteration may also be the mark of the best portraiture,
  <i>pace</i> Lord Fisher, commendation should be given to Mr. John for
  continuing to visualize the great seaman as Jupiter Tonans flashing in
  gold lace."</p>

  <p>How delightful it is, after the arid methods of the modern critics,
  bred up on <font class="sc">Benedetto Croce</font>, to hear the old
  authentic leonine ecstasy of <font class="sc">Sala</font>, "monarch of
  the florid quill!" Mr. Punch, once hailed by the <i>D.T.</i> as "the
  Democritus of Fleet Street," on the strength of his "memorable
  monosyllabic monition," in turn salutes the immortal protagonist of the
  purple polysyllable.</p>

<h3>WITCHCRAFT.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Mediæval Tragedy.</i>)</p>

  <p>"I want," said the maiden, glancing round her with tremulous distaste
  at the stuffed crocodile, the black cat and the cauldron simmering on the
  hearth, "to see some of your complexion specialities."</p>

  <p>"You want nothing of the kind," retorted the witch. "Why prevaricate?
  A maid with your colour hath small need even of my triple extract of
  toads' livers. What you have really come for is either a
  love-potion&mdash;" she paused and glanced keenly at her
  visitor&mdash;"or the means to avenge love unrequited."</p>

  <p>The maiden had flushed crimson. "I wish he were dead!" she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>"Now you are talking. That wish is, of course, the simplest thing in
  the world to gratify, if only you are prepared to pay for it. I presume
  Moddam would not desire anything too easy?"</p>

  <p>"He had promised,", broke out the maiden uncontrollably, "to take me
  to the charity bear-baiting matinée in aid of unemployed ex-Crusaders.
  The whole thing was arranged. And then at the last moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Precisely as I had supposed. A case for one of our superior wax
  images, made to model, with pins complete. Melted before a slow fire
  ensures the gradual wasting of the original with pangs corresponding to
  the insertion of each pin."</p>

  <p>The customer's fine eyes gleamed. "Give me one."</p>

  <p>"I will sell you one," corrected the witch. "But I should warn you.
  They are not cheap."</p>

  <p>"No matter."</p>

  <p>"Good. I was about to observe that since our sovereign liege <font
  class="sc">King Richard</font> granted peace to the Saracen the cost both
  of material and labour hath so parlously risen that I am unable to supply
  a really reliable article under fifty golden angels."</p>

  <p>"I have them here."</p>

  <p>"With special pins, of course, extra."</p>

  <p>"Take what you will." The maiden flung down a leathern wallet that
  chinked pleasingly. The witch, having transferred the contents of this to
  her own pocket, proceeded to fashion the required charm, watched by her
  client with half-repelled eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Hawk's eye, falcon's nose, raven's lock, peacock's clothes," chanted
  the crone, following the words with her cunning fingers.</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how know you him?" Panic was in the voice.</p>

  <p>The other laughed unpleasantly. "Doth not the whole district know the
  Lord &#338;il-de-Veau by reputation?" She held out the image. "Handle him
  carefully and use a fresh pin for each record."</p>

  <p>The maid snatched it from her hands and was turning towards the door
  of the hut when a low tap on its outer surface caused her to shrink back
  alarmed. The witch had again been watching her with an ambiguous smile.
  "Should Moddam wish to avoid observation," she suggested, "the side exit
  behind yonder curtain&mdash;" In an instant she was alone. Flinging the
  empty wallet into the darkest corner the witch (not without sundry
  chuckles) slowly unbarred the entrance.</p>

  <p>On the threshold stood a slim female figure enveloped in a cloak. "The
  love potion I had here last week," began a timid voice, "seems hardly
  satisfactory. If you stock a stronger quality, no matter how
  expensive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Step inside," said the witch.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Some couple of months later the ladies of the house-party assembled at
  Sangazure Castle for the Victory jousts were gathered in the great hall,
  exchanging gossip and serf-stories in the firelight while awaiting the
  return of their menkind.</p>

  <p>"Hath any heard," lisped one fair young thing, "how fareth the Lord
  &#338;il-de-Veau? They tell me that some mysterious ailment hath him in
  thrall."</p>

  <p>At the words the Lady Yolande Sangazure (whom we have met before) was
  aware of a crimson flood mounting swiftly to her exquisite temples.
  Strange to add, the same phenomenon might have been observed in a score
  of damosels belonging to the best families in the district. The hall
  seemed suffused in a ruddy glow that was certainly not reflected from the
  exiguous pile of post-Crusading fuel smouldering on the great hearth.</p>

  <p>"Tush!" broke in the cracked voice of a withered old dame, "your news
  is old. Not only hath the so-called fever vanished but my lord himself
  hath followed it."</p>

  <p>"Gone!" The cry was echoed by twenty voices; twenty embroidery-frames
  fell from forty arrested hands, while nine-and-thirty dismayed eyes fixed
  themselves upon the maliciously-amused countenance of the speaker. Only
  one, belonging to the Lady Beauregarde, who squinted slightly, remained
  as though unmoved by the general commotion.</p>

  <p>"Moreover," continued the old dame, "report saith that with him went
  his leman, who, having some art in necromancy, transformed her beauty to
  the semblance of a witch and provided her own dowry by the sale, to
  certain addle-pated wenches, of charms for which her lover himself
  prepared the market."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;his fever?" an impetuous voice broke in.</p>

  <p>"Cozening, no doubt. Of course the tale may be but idle babble; still,
  if true, one would admit that such credulous fools got no more than they
  deserved."</p>

  <p>She ceased, well satisfied. "I fancy," observed the Lady Yolande
  coldly, "that I hear our lords returning." And in the eloquent silence a
  score of fair young minds slowly assimilated the profound truth (as fresh
  to-day as eight hundred years ago) that Satan finds some mischief still
  for the impecunious demobilised.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>We are apt to think of Lord <font class="sc">Northcliffe</font> as the
  "onlie begetter" of the New Journalism. But here comes Mr. <font
  class="sc">Kennedy Jones</font>, M.P., to remind us, in <i>Fleet Street
  and Downing Street</i> (<font class="sc">Hutchinson</font>), that he too
  had a very large share in its parentage. And up to a point he is a proud
  father. Circulations reckoned in millions instead of thousands,
  journalistic salaries raised from hundreds to thousands,
  advertisement-revenues multiplied many-fold&mdash;these are some of the
  outward signs of the success of a policy which the author summarised when
  he told Lord <font class="sc">Morley</font>, "You left journalism as a
  profession; we have made it a branch of commerce." But there is another
  side to the medal. <i>Frankenstein's</i> monster was perfect in
  everything save that it lacked a soul. In all material things the New
  Journalism is a long way ahead of the Old; and yet, after chronicling its
  many triumphs&mdash;culminating in the capture of <i>The
  Times</i>&mdash;its part-creator is fain to admit that "public distrust
  of news is the most notable feature in journalism of recent years," and
  that the influence of the daily Press on the public mind has hardly ever
  been at a lower ebb. This frankness is characteristic of a book which on
  nearly every page contains something to startle or amuse. The author's
  experiences on his first day in London, including an encounter with a
  sausage-seller (more friendly than <font class="sc">Cleon's</font>
  rival); his negotiations for the purchase of <i>The Times</i>, and his
  offer of the editorship to Lord <font class="sc">Curzon</font>, who
  unfortunately refused it; the <i>provenance</i> of "The Pekin Massacre,"
  which originated, it appears, not with a "stunt" journalist, but with a
  Chinese statesman wishing to pull the Occidental leg&mdash;these and many
  other incidents are admirably described by a writer who, though he long
  ago doffed his journalistic harness, has not forgotten how to write up a
  "good story." Be your opinion of the New Journalism what it may I
  guarantee that you will find its champion an agreeable companion.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There are parts of Mr. <font class="sc">W.J. Locke's</font> latest
  novel, <i>The House of Baltazar</i> (<font class="sc">Lane</font>), which
  will, I fear, make almost prohibitive demands upon the faith (considered
  as belief in the incredible) of his vast following. To begin with, he
  introduces us to that problematical personage, whose possibility used to
  be so much debated, the Man Who Didn't Know There Was A War On. <i>John
  Baltazar</i> had preserved this unique ignorance, first by bolting from a
  Cambridge professorship through amorous complications, next by living
  many years in the Far East, and finally by settling upon a remote
  moorland farm (locality unspecified) with a taciturn Chinaman and an
  Airedale for his only companions. This and other contributory
  circumstances, for which I lack space, just enabled me to admit the
  situation as possible. Naturally, therefore, when a befogged Zeppelin
  laid a couple of bombs plonk into the homestead, the ex-professor
  experienced a mental as well as a bodily <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> shake-up. I had no
  complaint either with the transformation that developed <i>John
  Baltazar</i> from the only outsider to apparently the big boss of the
  War; while the scenes between him and the son of whose existence he had
  been unaware (a situation not precisely new to fiction) are presented
  with a sincere and moving simplicity. So far so good, even if hardly
  equal to the author's best. But the catastrophe and the melodramatics
  about War-Office secrets, preposterously put on paper, and still more
  preposterously preserved, simply knocked the wind of reality out of the
  whole affair. A pity, since Mr. <font class="sc">Locke</font> (though I
  prefer him in more fantastic vein) has clearly spent much care upon a
  tale that, till its final plunge, is at least lively and
  entertaining.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The amateur of lace, whether as expert or owner, will be pleasantly
  stirred by learning that another book has been added to the already large
  bibliography of a fascinating subject in <i>The Romance of the Lace
  Pillow</i> (<font class="sc">H.H. Armstrong</font>), published at Olney
  from the pen of Mr. <font class="sc">Thomas Wright</font>. Olney, of
  course, has two claims on our regard&mdash;<font class="sc">Cowper</font>
  and Lace, and it is now evident that Mr. <font class="sc">Wright</font>
  has kept as attentive an eye on the one as on the other. His book makes
  no pretence to be more than a brief and frankly popular survey of the art
  of lace-making chiefly in Northamptonshire and Bucks, and to it he has
  brought a wealth of various information (which the average reader must
  take on trust) and an enthusiasm that can be judged by his opening
  statement that "lace ... is the expression of the most rapturous moments
  of whole dynasties of men of genius." So now you know. Even those of us
  who regard it with a calmer pulse can take pleasure in the many excellent
  photographs of lace-work of different periods and schools that adorn Mr.
  <font class="sc">Wright's</font> volume. As for the letter-press, though
  I will not call the writer's style wholly equal to his zeal, his chapters
  are full of interesting gossip, ranging from the late <font
  class="sc">Katherine of Aragon</font> (the originator, according to one
  theory, of English lace-making), to some jolly stuff on the literature of
  Bobbins and the old Tells, or working-songs, sung by "the spinners and
  the knitters in the sun, and the free maids that weave their threads with
  bones." I have a fancy that the whole volume has been more or less a
  labour of love (never certainly did I meet an author with such a list of
  helpers to thank), so I am glad to think that its reward in one sense is
  already assured.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In <i>The Fairy Man</i> (<font class="sc">Dent</font>), a most
  engrossing phantasy, Mr. <font class="sc">L. Cope Cornford</font> takes
  for raw material a family of Maida Vale, victims of all those petty,
  sordid, but deadly troubles known only to the middle class. Without
  warrant, explanation, or excuse he introduces into their routine a sudden
  touch of magic; the tired City man, the acid foster-mother, the children
  (mercifully devoid of any priggishness), and the pre-eminently human
  housemaid and cook are transplanted for a moment into the age of the
  knights-errant. Thither also are transplanted their special friends and
  enemies, all retaining their modern identities and their current
  troubles, and all getting unpleasantly involved in the troubles of the
  ancients, to boot. Eventually the interlude is found to have provided the
  solution of the difficulties, pecuniary and other, of the home in Maida
  Vale; and I will say no more than that a very telling story ends well and
  naturally. No reader should imagine he has read all this before; the
  admixture of fairy imagination with the intensely practical things of
  life is something new, and there is a definite purpose in it all. The
  book may be labelled intellectual, but the characters always remain very
  human; thus <i>George</i>, finding himself back in the times of a
  thousand years ago, says critically, "It looks old, but it feels just the
  same;" and his father, seeing him engaged in an assault on the castle,
  shouts, "George! put that sword down instantly." Mr. <font
  class="sc">Cornford</font> makes his points with such discretion and
  understanding that even the most solid materialist must, after reading,
  feel a little less sure of himself.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I rather think that if I had the opportunity of discussing with <font
  class="sc">Elinor Mordaunt</font> her <i>Old Wine in New Bottles</i>
  (<font class="sc">Hutchinson</font>) and had the courage to say what was
  in my mind: "Don't you think perhaps that your vigorous and unexpected
  characters are out of story-land rather than out of life?" and if she
  riposted, "But is it necessary they should be like life if they are
  life-like?" I should be left with no more effective retort than "Quite,"
  or something just as futile. For there's no doubt that these queer
  villains, Chinese dealers, bold sailormen, travellers, rapt lovers, do
  get over the footlights in an effective way. They do the things that are
  only done in magazines, but they do them with a gusto which engages the
  attention. Perhaps indeed that's what the author meant by her ingenious
  title; though I suppose her device of setting before each story a longer
  or shorter, more or less relevant, passage from the Old Testament gives a
  clearer clue to the precise way in which she interprets "nothing new
  under the sun." I cheerfully prescribe of this old wine one or two
  bottles at bedtime. Better not, I think, the whole case at a sitting.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
